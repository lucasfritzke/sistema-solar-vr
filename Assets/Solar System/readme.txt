Description
--------------------
This package includes the star, Sol, nine planets (including Pluto), and a total of 23 well known 
moons. The moons orbit their parent planet and the planets orbit the parent star. The planets 
also include an orbit trail that marks their orbit around the star. This model is not to scale.

Included Assets and Usage
--------------------
1)	Included in this package are the star Sol and nine planets (including Pluto) and a total of 23 well known moons.
2)	Each body is textured with NASA satellite images and have been colorized and the blanks filled in as necessary to complete the texture map. In many of the moons cases there are no satellite images so I made them up. I tried to be as accurate as possible when texturing the planets. 
3)	Each Planet orbits the sun, Sol and each moon orbits its respective parent.
4)	Each planet has a trail renderer component marking the planet's orbital path. The length of this can be adjusted on the component. If you don’t want to have the trails, simply remove or disable the component child from the planet body.
5)	Venus has two associated maps and spheres. The inner one is the ground layer and the larger one is the cloud layer. Adjust the alpha for transparency.
6)	Similarly, Earth has multiple maps: One with land features only and one with land and clouds. There are also 6 transparent cloud maps that you can adjust the alpha on and place on the outer cloud sphere.
7)	The speed of the orbits of the planets around the sun are not to scale, though the outer planets move slower by default for aesthetics.
8)	The orbits of the moons around their parent planet are not accurate nor are they in any particular order. 
9)	The distance of each body from its parent is not to scale. 
10)	Also included is a basic starfield skybox, a pointlight to illuminate the scene, and a the sun is self-illuminating. If you want to have the sun cast light or produce solar flares, you’ll have to build that.
11)	The orbit of each body has an “orbit” script attached to it. The variables are modifiable along each X,Y,Z axis, and the Orbital Speed determines how fast the body orbits its parent.
